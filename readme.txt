Imagick doesn't handle tranparency with current WordPress settings. Now it does.

== Description ==

PDF thumbnails, automagicly generated by WordPress, don't handle transparency very well. This results in black pages.

In https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45982 and https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39216 there are workarounds, this plugin implements:

`$this->image->setImageAlphaChannel( Imagick::ALPHACHANNEL_REMOVE );`

This works for me using PHP7.2 with ImageMagick 6.9.10 and ghostscript 9.5.

== Installation ==

* Download the plugin
* Uncompress it with your preferred unzip program
* Copy the entire directory in your plugin directory of your WordPress blog (/wp-content/plugins)
* Activate the plugin

= 1.0 =

* For attachments with a PDF extention: set the alpha channel to `Imagick::ALPHACHANNEL_REMOVE`
